# This is an example configuration file for the Local DNS Service addon.
#
# 1. RENAME THIS FILE to `devices.conf`.
# 2. PLACE IT in the addon's data directory.
#    - The typical path is `/usr/share/hassio/addons/data/local_dns/devices.conf`
#    - You can access this location using the VSCode or File Editor addon in Home Assistant.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# - Add one device per line.
# - The format is: MAC_ADDRESS:HOSTNAME:DESCRIPTION
# - The MAC address MUST be in lowercase.
# - The hostname should not contain spaces. Using a local-style domain like `.home` or `.lan` is a good practice.
# - The description is optional and is used for logging purposes.
